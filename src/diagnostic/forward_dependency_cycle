#error Cycle detected in forward dependencies!

// This diagnostic is used in FWD files, which have a "_fwd.hpp" suffix and
// are for declarations ONLY. These files have a special header guard that will
// produce the above error when the FWD file inadvertently includes itself.
//
// The idea here is that, once they arise, dependency cycles between
// declarations can be difficult to eliminate. But this diagnostic should be
// able to help by giving you an error message with the chain of #includes
// that form the cycle.

// The rest of this file shows the typical layout of a FWD file.

// Notice that the rest of the FWD file is entirely unguarded.
// But this should be no problem so long as there are no definitions!
